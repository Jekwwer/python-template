@brief Helper module for utility functions.

@file src/utils/helpers.py
========================================================
@details This module contains utility functions that support the
         primary program logic. In this case, it provides a simple
         placeholder helper function for demonstration purposes.

@note This is a template. Update it with actual utility functions
      based on the project requirements.

@todo Add more utility functions as needed to support the main logic.

@warning Ensure that all necessary dependencies for the helper functions
         are installed and correctly imported before using them.

@code
from utils.helpers import helper_function

helper_function()

         in its current form in production code.
